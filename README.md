<h1>Chess_GUI_using_WPF</h1>
<p>
This repository was created for my Chess_GUI project based on youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFk1_lkqT8MahHPi40ON-jyo5wiqnyHsL.<br>
My goal for this project is to finish all functionalities shown in the tutorial using my own coding style, and to add more.<br>
Currently the project is at its beginning.<br>

  <li>Highlighting squares using right click. Hightlights are hiding either when selecting piece to move or when rightclicking on the same square again. If piece is currently selected highlighting square deselects  it.</li>
</ol>
