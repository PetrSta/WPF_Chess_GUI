<h1>Chess_GUI_using_WPF</h1>
<p>
This repository was created for my Chess_GUI project based on youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFk1_lkqT8MahHPi40ON-jyo5wiqnyHsL.<br>
My goal for this project is to finish all functionalities shown in the tutorial using my own coding style, and to add more.<br>
Currently the project is at its beginning.<br>
I would also like to let it be known that the assets were downloaded from:<br>
https://freesvg.org/simple-chessboard<br>
https://freesvg.org/chess-pieces-vector<br>
Afterwards I edited them using gimp, but baseline was downloaded from the above links.<br>

<ins>Custom functionalities:</ins><br>
<ol>
  <li>Highlighting squares using right click. Hightlights are hiding either when selecting piece to move or when rightclicking on the same square again. If piece is currently selected highlighting square deselects  it.</li>
</ol>
